            "After a substantially longer than anticipated development period, we're happy to provide our first release of the year, as well as an update on the discussions regarding Rhino Linux's development goals and structure.",
            
            "Before we get into information about this release, we have a brief update about our organizational structure. As we mentioned a while ago, developer burnout hit a breaking point for some us, and in consequence devlepment has somewhat stagnated. We have begun discussions about how we wish to structure Rhino Linux going forward, and are happy to announce that we have currently drafted a working Rhino Linux constitution, with a hard focus on community involvement. These structural changes will begin to come into effect shortly after this release, so stay tuned for the full announcement!"
